The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never.

Promises are, just like callbacks, a way of dealing with things being asynchronous - when we don't know for certain in what order things will happen. But promises are more powerful than callbacks because they compose - you can combine promises and chain them.

 -Promises are similar to structured callbacks.
