## Grammar and types
+ JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python.

+ JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set.

+ In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by a semicolon (;). Spaces, tabs and newline characters are called whitespace.

**Declarations**

There are three kinds of declarations in JavaScript.

+ *var :*
    Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

+ *let :*
    Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

+ *const :*
    Declares a read-only named constant.

**Variables :** The names of variables, called identifiers.

**Identifier :** A sequence of characters in the code that identifies a variable, function, or property.

In JavaScript, identifiers can contain only alphanumeric characters (or "$" or " _ "), and may not start with a digit.

**Evaluating variables**

+ An attempt to access an undeclared variable will result in a ReferenceError exception being thrown.

+ The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context.

+ The undefined value converts to NaN when used in numeric context.

+ When you evaluate a null variable, the null value behaves as 0 in numeric contexts and as false in boolean contexts.

**Variable hoisting :**
In JavaScript is that you can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception. This concept is known as hoisting.

**Global variables :**
Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

**Constants**
+ A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.

+ You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.

**Data structures and types**

Data types

The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
+ Six data types that are primitives:
  - Boolean. true and false.
  - null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
  - undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
  - Number. 42 or 3.14159.
  - String. "Howdy"
  - Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.

+ and Object

You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.


#### Data type conversion
+ JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. That means you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it, and data types are converted automatically as needed during script execution.

+ \+ operator, JavaScript converts numeric values to strings.

+ other operators, JavaScript does not convert numeric values to strings.

#### Literals
+ A literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code.
+ These are fixed values, not variables, that you literally provide in your script.

+ **Array literals :** An array literal is a type of object initializer.

  - If you put two commas in a row, the array is created with undefined for the unspecified elements.
  - If you include a trailing comma at the end of the list of elements, the comma is ignored.


+ **Boolean literals :** The Boolean type has two literal values: true and false.

  - The Boolean object is a wrapper around the primitive Boolean data type.



+ **Object literals**

  - Object property names can be any string, including the empty string.

  - If the property name would not be a valid JavaScript identifier, it must be enclosed in quotes.

  - Property names that would not be valid identifiers also cannot be accessed as a dot (.) property, but can be accessed and set with the array-like notation("[]").

  - Please note

    var foo = {a: "alpha", 2: "two"};

    console.log(foo.a);    // alpha

    console.log(foo[2]);   // two

    //console.log(foo.2);  // Error: missing ) after argument list

    //console.log(foo[a]); // Error: a is not defined

    console.log(foo["a"]); // alpha

    console.log(foo["2"]); // two

+ **String literals**

You can call any of the methods of the String object on a string literal valueâ€”JavaScript automatically converts the string literal to a temporary String object, calls the method, then discards the temporary String object.


## Control flow and error handling

+ The following values will evaluate to false:

  - false
  - undefined
  - null
  - 0
  - NaN
  - the empty string ("")

All other values, including all objects evaluate to true when passed to a conditional statement.


+ **Promises**

 Promise objects allowing you to control the flow of deferred and asynchronous operations.

 A Promise is in one of these states:

    - pending: initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.
    - fulfilled: successful operation
    - rejected: failed operation.
    - settled: the Promise is either fulfilled or rejected, but not pending.


## Loops and iteration

+ **for...in statement**

The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object.

+ **for...of statement**

The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set, arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property.

The following example shows the difference between a for...of loop and a for...in loop. While for...in iterates over property names, for...of iterates over property values:

let arr = [3, 5, 7];

arr.foo = "hello";

for (let i in arr) {

   console.log(i); // logs "0", "1", "2", "foo"

}

for (let i of arr) {

   console.log(i); // logs "3", "5", "7"

}

## Functions
+ Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.

+ If you pass an object (i.e. a non-primitive value, such as Array or a user-defined object) as a parameter and the function changes the object's properties,that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:

```
function myFunc(theObject) {
  theObject.make = "Toyota";
}

var mycar = {make: "Honda", model: "Accord", year: 1998};
var x, y;

x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"

myFunc(mycar);
y = mycar.make; // y gets the value "Toyota"
                // (the make property was changed by the function)

```

##### Function expressions
---
+ A function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name.
```
var square = function(number) { return number * number };
var x = square(4) // x gets the value 16
```
+ However, a name can be provided with a function expression and can be used inside the function to refer to itself, or in a debugger to identify the function in stack traces.

  ```
  var factorial = function fac(n) { return n<2 ? 1 : n*fac(n-1) };

  console.log(factorial(3));
  ```

+ Function expressions are convenient when passing a function as an argument to another function. The following example shows a map function being defined and then called with an anonymous function as its first parameter:

  ```
  function map(f,a) {
    var result = [], // Create a new Array
        i;
    for (i = 0; i != a.length; i++)
      result[i] = f(a[i]);
    return result;
  }
  ```
The following code:
`map(function(x) {return x * x * x}, [0, 1, 2, 5, 10]);`

returns [0, 1, 8, 125, 1000].

#### Calling functions
+ Defining a function does not execute it.
+ Defining the function simply names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.
+ Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters.
+ Functions must be in scope when they are called, but the function declaration can be hoisted (appear below the call in the code), as in this example:

    ```
    console.log(square(5));
    /* ... */
    function square(n) { return n*n }
    ```
+ The scope of a function is the function in which it is declared, or the entire program if it is declared at the top level.

**Note:** This works only when defining the function using the above syntax (i.e. function funcName(){}). The code below will not work.
  ```
  console.log(square(5));
  square = function (n) {
    return n * n;
  }
  ```
 + The arguments of a function are not limited to strings and numbers. You can pass whole objects to a function.
