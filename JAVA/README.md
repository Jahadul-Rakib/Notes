## Java

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as as single unit. In encapsulation the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class, therefore it is also known as data hiding.

**To achieve encapsulation in Java**

- Declare the variables of a class as private.

- Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

**Benefits of Encapsulation:**

- The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only.

- A class can have total control over what is stored in its fields.

- The users of a class do not know how the class stores its data. A class can change the data type of a field and users of the class do not need to change any of their code.


### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.
